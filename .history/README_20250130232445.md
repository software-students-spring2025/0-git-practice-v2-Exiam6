# Golden Rules for Software Developer

## Things to Read

I recently came across an insightful article titled [**20 Golden Rules to Learn in Software Development**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/20-golden-rules-to-learn-in-software-development/) on GeeksforGeeks that I found particularly compelling.

## Lessons Learned


### 1. Controlling The Complexity

A recurring challenge I faced was the tendency to write large volumes of code without testing each function's functionality in isolation. This lack of modular testing often resulted in complex interdependencies and bugs that are difficult to trace . The rule of **Controlling The Complexity** emphasized the importance of breaking down code into manageable, testable units. By adopting this practice, I was able to ensure that each component functions correctly before integrating it into the larger research projects, thereby reducing errors and simplifying debugging processes (A lot of pain since I'm working on real world robots).

### 2. Do Not Underestimate

Overconfidence in my coding abilities sometimes led me to believe that my solutions were flawless, causing me to overlook corner cases and out-of-domain data scenarios. This oversight resulted in software that performed well under expected conditions but faltered when confronted with unexpected inputs. The **Do Not Underestimate** rule served as a crucial reminder to start early before the ddl.

This was a great read and I realized that many of the rules that were listed, I had not yet adopted. For me, and I'm sure many other students in this class, creating and working on a large code base with a large team, isn't something that we've all had extensive experience with. As a result of this lack of large-scale code writing, we often use practices that work best for us, which wouldn't be the best when working for a company. Even tools like Git, which I don't use often when I'm writing code for my own projects, has been an adjustment I've made to make sure I can effortlessly make the transition from school projects to professional work. I plan on focusing on **rule 6: maintenance** and **rule 10: don't chase too much perfection**. These two rules go hand in hand into ensuring that you have good foundational code base that you can easily upgrade and maintain. These two rules also seem to closely align with the things we'd need to keep in mind if working under the incremental development methodology that we learned about a couple classes ago. Thanks for sharing this article!

Also, it's really cool that you're working on robots!
