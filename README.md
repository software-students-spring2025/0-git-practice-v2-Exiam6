# Golden Rules for Software Developer

## Things to Read

I recently came across an insightful article titled [**20 Golden Rules to Learn in Software Development**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/20-golden-rules-to-learn-in-software-development/) on GeeksforGeeks that I found particularly compelling.

## Lessons Learned


### 1. Controlling The Complexity

A recurring challenge I faced was the tendency to write large volumes of code without testing each function's functionality in isolation. This lack of modular testing often resulted in complex interdependencies and bugs that are difficult to trace . The rule of **Controlling The Complexity** emphasized the importance of breaking down code into manageable, testable units. By adopting this practice, I was able to ensure that each component functions correctly before integrating it into the larger research projects, thereby reducing errors and simplifying debugging processes (A lot of pain since I'm working on real world robots).

### 2. Do Not Underestimate

Overconfidence in my coding abilities sometimes led me to believe that my solutions were flawless, causing me to overlook corner cases and out-of-domain data scenarios. This oversight resulted in software that performed well under expected conditions but faltered when confronted with unexpected inputs. The **Do Not Underestimate** rule served as a crucial reminder to start early before the ddl.
